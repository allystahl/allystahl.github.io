                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Copenhagen Pastry differs from other bakeries through our emphasis on using authentic Danish recipes, traditional baking methods and the finest quality ingredients to create pastries that are flaky, light and delicately sweet without being sugary or heavy. Quality control, consistency and continuity are important to Copenhagen Pastry and among the reasons that our selections overall remain the same week after week.
                Our fillings are primarily almond paste and custard in various ratios along with cinnamon, almond flakes and traditional Danish fruit fillings (apple, raspberry, apricot and blueberry). We always have trays with samples available for new and returning customers at Copenhagen Pastry. We are confident that our pastries market themselves better than our words can convey.
                ​At Copenhagen Pastry we bake pastries throughout the day as demand dictates. Customers will always leave with freshly baked goods.

                <p>Customers can peek through a window into the production area and watch our bakers go about their work, baking and decorating pastries.Among our signature offerings is a wholegrain rye bread containing the goodness of whole rye berries, black flax seeds, sunflower and sesame seeds. Our rye bread is a thoroughly healthy bread high in fiber, low in sodium and sugar free. Copenhagen Pastry staff strives to provide the highest possible customer service. We enjoy the interaction with our customers and gladly share pastry stories and all things about Denmark and Danes. Our bakery does not offer a café-like setting. Instead we encourage our customers to take their purchases to a place where the pastries can be shared with family and friends in a relaxed, cozy setting.</p>
